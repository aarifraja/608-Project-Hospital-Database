README :


The project has 2 frontend(frontend-final.py ,second.py ) and  2 backendfiles(backend_final.py, backend2.py).

-->All these files need to be placed in single folder.

-->Execute the frontend-final.py script.This can be done by navigating to the folder directory 
containing the files and use "python3 frontend-final.py". It should also work with python2.

-->The above step launches the appplication and provides user interface to be used by the user.
